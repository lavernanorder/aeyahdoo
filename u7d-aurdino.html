                            <p>Open-source electronic prototyping platform enabling users to create interactive electronic objects. Arduino. The microcontrollers are typically programmed using a dialect of features from the programming languages C and C++. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) based on the Processing language project. Arduino. 901K likes. Arduino is an open-source hardware, software, and content platform with a worldwide community of over 30 million active users. Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board. 
 I want to build a pc fan controller that uses temperature to control the amount of voltage that is provided to the fans.My question is can i control the amount of voltage pushed by relay's to the fans since my fans are 3 pin fans the only method to control them is via changing the vcc. My motherboard has that functionality in built but linux does not support it rather my mother boards chipset wont allow me to control it using linux. Arduino IDE это простая среда для разработки прошивок и загрузки их в память микроконтроллера. СКАЧАТЬ, как установить, как настроить и как пользоваться. SparkFun WiFi Shield - ESP8266.

ELEGOO for Arduino Nano V3.0, Nano Board CH340/ATmega328P Without USB Cable, Compatible with Arduino Nano V3.0 (Nano x 3 Without Cable). I recently bricked my Buffalo WZR-1750DHP after pushing the wrong firmware file onto it. My roommate has an Arduino board, and THIS forum on how to unbrick it ( fails to mention the commands you're giving to the Arduino, so we decided not to bother. I really don't know where to begin when it comes to this stuff - that link above doesn't mention how to program the Arduino at all! Any help is appreciated. the arduino software is provided to you "as is" and we make no express or implied warranties whatsoever with respect to its functionality, operability, or use, including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or infringement. So I got this idea to make this Aurdino thing that I can hook up to LEDs and have a software to control them with different effects (kinda like HUE+, just that hue+ is too expensive so kind of a home made version) I have almost no experience with Aurdino but want to learn. ALSO If anyone has ANY ideas to some PC mod I can use with an Aurdino that has some kinda special features or just any cool mod at all that would work I really need ideas

Howdy. I'm a electronics beginner just starting to learn about Aurdino. I stumbled across this article which talks about " 10 ways to destroy aurdino ( However on the same hand i found this example on the aurdino website which talks about " reading a potentiometer ( In the '10 ways to destroy aurdino', it specifically says that one way to cause damage is: 'Method #2: Shorting Arduino Create simplifies building a project as a whole, without having to switch between different tools to manage all the aspects of whatever you're making. Anybody need ghosts?. This article is about the species. For a specific instance of this species, see Audino (disambiguation). So I've doing this programming thing for a while now, a year or two maybe, and I'm lost. I've gone through Codecadamy's tutorial for python and I feel fairly confident in the language when it comes to making scripts. I've also learnt TI-BASIC which is the language that runs on the calculators from Texas Instruments (like the TI-82, TI-83, TI-84) where I've made a few games to keep me occupied during math class. So what now? I want to go graphical. I want to learn how make something useful. Massimo Banzi helped invent the Arduino, a tiny, easy-to-use open-source microcontroller that's inspired thousands of people around 
There are many different ideas about how to watercool a PC. I wanted to see how the internals of my loop were performing so I put the Arduino I had lying around to good use. Before this project I had only done really the basic Arduino tutorials so it's not advanced at all. Some basic electronics knowledge is nice to have though. You will need the equipment and knowledge to solder. There are many ways to measure temperature in a system so you need to decide. Только что получил aurdino uno, что мне делать. Есть ли какие-нибудь интересные проекты или есть хорошие веб-сайты, чтобы узнать, как их кодировать, любые ссылки будут. I came upon 3 Newport DC voltmeters with Nixie Tubes at a yard sail and I've been wanting to make something a little more useful ever since. I am hoping to incorporate a multimeter and a clock. Has anyone seen anything like this done? Would it be better to make the logic for a clock and multimeteter on a chip and then output it to the tubes or try and tie the outputs of an already existing multimeter and clock to the tubes.

Тема ESP8266, как и IoT(интернет вещей), всё больше набирает популярности, и уже Arduino подхватывает инициативу — добавляя эти Wi-Fi модули в список. I'm in web app development so picking up arduino's language shouldn't be too hard to do, but I've never worked with hardware; just looking for points in the right direction and terms to start Googling myself. When I plug the USB handbrake into my Windows 10 PC, it appears as "Arduino Micro" but should appear as "HID-compliant game controller." It does not work with the various games I play: Project Cars 2, Dirt Rally, and Forza. There are 2 magnets. As you pull the handbrake, the magnets Mert Arduino and Tech; Arduino, Arduino Project, Arduino Robot, Arduino Tutorial, Arduino Robot Arm, How to make, Arduino DIY, Top 10 Arduino Projects So I have had my printer for about 4 years now using it fairly regularly. At one point I upgraded it to a dual extruder setup but had to disable the second extruder due to some weird issues it was causing. (Thermal cutoff i believe even though the temps were fine. Tried spare hotends and different temperature sensors with the same issue.) Well just recently without me making any modifications to what I do, the printer has started pausing briefly on prints. It almost acting as if it needs

I just bought a BL Touch auto level sensor and already have an Arduino needed to flash the firmware. I saw a couple days a go an "official" (https://www.creality3donline.com/creality-bl-touch-auto-bed-leveling-cr-10-ender-3-cr-10s-s4-s5-cr20-20pro_p0135.html) kit was posted with firmware provided. I was wondering if anyone knew if it would be possible to just flash what they provided using the Aurdino instead of the usb stick. The Arduino IoT Cloud allows you to register devices that you may control remotely from the dashboard. You'll be able to send data, change settings, as well as receive sensor. I wanted to get opinions on if my idea was even possible based on my skill set. I’m willing to learn more and have done some of the “playground” tutorials.which were super easy and also not what I was looking for. I’m sure I would get into stuff I don’t know if I looked for more. I have a small background in coding that is, I did a if/then text only dungeon crawler in high school, some COBOL in college and then some C++ to program an Aurdino a few years ago. The game board if i use aurdino for decoding the button code of a tv remote then can i use the same decoded button code for 8051 mirocontroller to program ? only the button. I recently purchased \(and assembled\) my A8\-M. After scouring the web I've already completed most of the recommended upgrades; the mosfet for the heat bed, the spade connectors for the wiring, and upgraded power supply to name a few. I have already set up a Raspberry Pi with a webcam for Octoprint and I'm planning to add the auto bed leveling sensor as soon as it arrives from Amazon which I have read is something else that needs to be enabled in Marlin, which is my next trick, updating.

Hi, im looking to build a bi-copter or dual? not sure exactly what names goes. Servo (yes) Motor (yes probs switch it out for better) Aurdino (no) Technical Plastic (Heat sensitive plastic for building) Gyroscope??? Accelerometer???? any good tutorials to build. So I have an Airquality sensor for a mikroelectronika board and click board adapter so I can put it on the arudino. The problem is that the mikroelectronica gives code examples for its own compliers which is in like a mpkg file which aurdino does not recongize, and mikroelectrinka does not give out its compliers for free. So I was confused on how I should try to move the code over. An idea I have is can I open the file in notepad and transfer the code to the arudino ide, and wish something. Good morning/afternoon, I have been enjoying my delta plus from anycubic for most of the last several months, the exception being the last few; and I am needing assistance troubleshooting why my printer fails to heat as I approach wits end. I have contacted support and am waiting for a reply. After the hot end reaches ~160C, the printer exclaims that the heating has failed, then initializes a hard stop. This happens every time the printer is heated. I was able to confirm its an issue Создание датчика температуры для облачной среды с помощью Arduino Uno и IBM IoT Foundation. I have two ESP8266's and I can not get either to even respond to AT command. I'm using a FDTI to esp8266 board. Tried to load the blink program on both boards from the aurdino libraries. Loaded successfully but doesn't run. tried both 9600 and 115200. ended up viewing bootloader at 76800 and it looks like i'm getting a checksum error. bootloader out put is shown here https://imgur.com/a/eJzD8 any idea how to fix this? both boards same problem. Access your personal Arduino information on your profile. Edit your credentials, Forum setting, and check your Store orders. I've got a newly assembled out of the box Bob's CNC E3. Using Universal Gcode Sender I get only the error that GRBL has not finished loading. The Aurdino Uno shows up in my Device Manger, I've got the ports and baud rate set properly (I think). The digging I've done so far points to no connection between the controller and my laptop. It also points to a ton of information that I don't pretend to understand. Any suggestions. Часть 1. Подготовка esp8266 Зачем эта статья? На хабре уже есть ряд статей про использование esp в разных конфигурациях, но почему-то без подробностей о том, как именно. 
My wife and I are the proud new owners of a Select Mini 3D Printer. We had a fair number of connectivity issues over the USB connection, but got a few prints out. Then, after a few days off, the printer is suddenly unrecognizable to my computer. It connected when I started it back up today, then Cura locked on the "opening serial port" dialog, and then my PC stopped recognizing it altogether. It now gives me the following error when turned on and plugged in: "The last USB device you connected. Space Year. 2019's Arduino Education thematic year: robots, satellites, radio communication systems, weather monitoring devices, maps, and more related to Space technology. I'm helping someone build a haptic motor system using Arduino but I am only a programmer with very basic circuit knowledge. We want to have a remote be able to turn either haptic motor A on or haptic motor B on (never 2 at the same time). It has to be tiny and run on battery so that's the biggest constraint. Would the following parts work for the project: Motor (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8449) Transistor to turn motors on/off (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13689) IR Recei. Download this app from Microsoft Store for Windows 10. See screenshots, read the latest customer reviews, and compare ratings for Arduino. I'm a newbie to electronics. I ordered an Arduino Uno and a USB Host Shield along with a Xbox 360 USB receiver. My question is if I power the Aurdino with 9v via the 2.1mm connector, will the voltage regulator produce less heat when I connect the USB Host shield and XBox 360 USB receiver to the Arduino.
